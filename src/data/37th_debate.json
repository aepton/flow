Ever since I was a teen, I've been doing advocacy and community organizing - really seeing firsthand in real time that failed War on Drugs that is still continuing now, really seeing the devastation in my community. It was at that time that I said I want to bring healing, restoration, and resources back to the community. So my vision is healthy families and healthy communities, and in doing so, we have to look at multiple issues - prioritizing housing, fully funding education, pre-K, health equity, and really centering racial justice. I just want to highlight very briefly some sole endorsers within the 37th - Senator Salda\u00f1a, Girmay Zahilay - our King County Councilmember, Tammy Morales, Andrew Lewis, Kim-Kh\u00e1nh - thank you so much.",

We have some really pressing issues facing us, and we need to send a proven leader to Olympia to solve them. Housing prices are out of control, and it's displacing generational families and making renters pay more of their paycheck to skyrocketing rents. People are struggling to make ends meet, and the pandemic has only made this worse. The recovery, or so-called recovery from the pandemic, hasn't been felt evenly by all of us, and we need to protect working people so that we all come out of the pandemic better than we went into it. The pandemic's also made our schools worse and exacerbated existing issues. Just recently, Black and Brown kids tested three and a half levels behind their counterparts, and I want to make sure that all kids have a great public education system like the one that I went through.

So if it unintentionally or intentionally causes more inequities and more harm to people of color and those marginalized, I have to look more deeply into that before I could just say a quick, simple yes or no. So I just want to share why there might have been a waffle there. And also, if I don't fully understand something and I need to learn a little bit more and lean into community organizations and lean into the community - we talked about the ID - that's a very diverse community, they're not a monolith. So if there's an issue that's happening in the ID, I need to lean and learn from that community before I just make a decision as a legislator to do so.

I think that our community, particularly in the 37th, is really intentional about our racial equity and about equity overall and fairness and all the great words. But we have to be actionable about that. And so putting something in the written language in our Constitution, we have to move in that direction.

Ironically, he is in a multiracial marriage. So the hypocrisy there, I don't think is lost on anyone. And I'm a product of a multiracial marriage - and so making sure that these rights are protected is deeply important to me. In terms of gay marriage, I am glad that we have a strong legislature and that passed marriage equality. In terms of Roe, I think we should fund clinics to take care of the increased traffic that we'll see in our state from the states that have - around us - that have banned abortion. I have background in technology. I would love to make sure that our data isn't used to go after people searching abortions or providing abortions. There's plenty of providers who provide telehealth. And if they are consulting with someone across state lines into a state that has banned abortion, I would be super scared about whether I could be sued, whether my data could be subpoenaed, if I could lose my license. And so making sure that we protect our data and protect our providers, I think, is paramount. Also making sure that we have security around our clinics - just as we'll have more traffic from people looking for abortions, we'll have more traffic from people protesting abortions. So those are some of the things that I would do to protect gay rights and the women's reproductive rights.",

And so - number one, making sure that when we look around at other types of businesses - like we have incubators for tech businesses, we have incubators in high-tech businesses. Why don't we have incubators for smaller businesses, for communities of color? Access to capital is one of the issues that holds businesses back - where I think we saw in the video - the guy who founded WeWork completely did a scam and then got another $350 million to go start Lord knows what. So making sure that we have access to capital in community is really important. Working with organizations like Tabor 100, who provide incubation-type services is really important. And then working to make sure that our communities foster businesses - so for example, businesses that are in walkable and bikeable areas get more traffic. Not only will that increase business to those businesses, it will also get us towards a greener climate future if we have an environment and community that encourages us to get out of single-occupancy vehicles.",

So a lot of our small businesses are pop-ups. So a lot of, even through COVID, the money that's coming from the federal government or from our local government agencies are not making it to the small businesses. Similar to what Chipalo was saying, you need capital to even get a loan, but also the money that was coming to support the businesses, it wasn't reaching those businesses. It seems like the same million dollar companies, people who always were getting the money kept getting the money. And also, when I think about the displacement that's happening in our community, I would like to see some restrictions or some policy that is not targeting our small businesses in neighborhoods or communities that have been historically gentrified and displaced. Similarly like the Central District, but all throughout the 37th - all the constant building could be harming - it has harmed our communities, most marginalized, but it also, in some ways, makes it harder for them to start up and rebuild. So there's education and awareness. Sometimes small businesses do not find out about the funding until it's too late. And so I'm hearing from business owners all the time about they're seeing, they feel like it's a scam. They feel like even though they've had some opportunity to try to start something up in cOVID, that it's gonna go away. It's gonna be the same old, same old people getting it all the time, the same status quo. So we gotta figure something out. We have some small business owners here in the neighborhood. Even in my campaign, I learned, the small businesses cannot unionize because it costs so much money. We should be figuring out a way to make sure our small businesses can get themselves the access in the door. And that is time. You said we can keep going. It wasn't a penalty, correct?",

For example, there are major Sound Transit investments coming online in the district at Judkins Park that are surrounded by unsafe freeway entrances on Rainier Avenue. It's not if, but when that folks in the 37th will be injured or killed by cars at that station entrance. And I should clarify, this is an audience question submitted before.

And so there's been - I see, oftentimes, those accidents. I see those fatalities. My heart goes out to the family of the mother who was killed at the Mount Baker station. I knew her before she was a mother. So these things are near and dear to my heart. When I think about traffic safety, I think that we have the data - Sound Transit does. They have the data that we should be - as things are being built and created, they should be co-designed with community, and then we should be making decisions while we're implementing these light rail stations, these new highways, whatever, it's not a highway, but these new ramps. All that should be taken into consideration in the beginning because the lives that are being lost mainly are BIPOC lives, Black and Indigenous people. And so our lives are being sacrificed for something that we never even asked for here in South Seattle. But I also want to think about traffic safety. I think about when our young Black men, who are the most targeted to even get on Sound Transit, being harassed because they're looking for ID or for payment - that to me is a safety issue. That's why oftentimes you may see me driving or driving my children somewhere because it's a safety issue because they may be harassed by the police, as well as those who tend to cycle.",

And that exposed me to some very nice bike trails, but also some very dangerous streets. And so if I'm elected into the legislature, I would want to make sure that we have a comprehensive network of connectivity. So regardless of what type of transportation network it is, it needs to be connected. We built a monorail from downtown to the stadium - like Climate Pledge - that doesn't do much. For a long time, our two streetcar networks weren't interconnected, which means people didn't want to use it. So we need to make sure that all of our infrastructure is connected. We need to invest in bike transit and infrastructure. And this is particularly important to the 37th, because we have two of the most dangerous streets in Rainier Ave and MLK Way, 40% of the injuries there are pedestrian. And I think this is a place where we can, I mentioned before, find a win-win with business, because businesses that are in bikeable and pedestrian-friendly areas get more business. So I believe this is a way that we can build a coalition around fixing the problem of safe streets in the 37th. And it's also an issue for our kids, because we have 10 or 11 schools that are on both of those two most dangerous streets. So we can make sure that our kids are safer today as well.",

So it's easy - it's one thing to put in a law, then you do have to fund the law, but you also have to implement it. So when it comes down to the other municipalities locally, sometimes they're stuck. So we have to make sure we're following the legislation all the way down to the community or to the district that you want and make sure that it's being implemented in a way, in a timely fashion as well - not three years, four years, five years down the line, but immediately. That should be part of the planning. So of course we have to fund it, but if we're not able to implement it, it's just words. So I would like, in my leadership role, is to make sure that there's language in the bill that makes it more accessible to our municipalities so that they can actually do something about it. If you put in the bill and it can't be ambiguous, it needs to be really focused and maybe restricted funding to air quality in the schools, rather than just saying, Here's some money to your school for air quality.

But nevertheless, what I have found in my experience - when there's a law passed - it takes the community to still apply the pressure on the entities and organizations to make something happen. So I have that experience, that organizing experience, and building those partnerships on the ground level to make sure it's being implemented.

I think in these two years - that you will see that that definitely happens. My granddaughter was born during COVID. My daughter almost lost her life during that birth. It is a well-known fact that Black women are three times as likely to lose their life during childbirth. So having a doula, having somebody there with culturally relevant care will make sure that the lives are not being lost. In addition to that, I am a board member of the Tubman Health Center - this is another place - making sure that we have capital investments to make sure that we create a clinic that is going to center Black and Indigenous community and bring culturally relevant care, and that will also serve our LGBTQ community.

We were just talking to an elderly gentleman who is part of - he was a state employee, and so he has one of the oldest pensions, but we have not funded that pension so that he cannot keep up with the rising housing prices. So when I think of housing, I think of how do we stop harm, how do we get more units on the market, and how do we tide ourselves to the way there. So stopping harm looks like anti-displacement measures, so making sure that seniors can afford the rising taxes, making sure that - right now what we have is we allow seniors to defer taxes, but once they die, then they have to pay all of those back taxes, which essentially forces a family to sell the house, unless you have $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 lying around. We also need to increase renter protections - landlords can do some crazy things. Even though I'm a landlord myself, I live that business through progressive values, so we can't allow felons to be disqualified from having housing. I have a tenant who's a felon, he's one of my best tenants. We should lift the ban on rental control, we should - rent control statewide. We should limit the types of fees that a landlord can charge their tenants. In terms of long-term measures, we need to invest in low-income housing through the Housing Trust Fund. We need to figure out something about workforce housing because even two teachers who are underpaid already - if they're living together, they can't afford housing in the district - and we need to invest in mass transit to increase density around it to get us towards a greener climate future and have more houses.",

Community development for us by us - the Elizabeth Thomas Homes of Rainier Beach, the Ethiopian Village here in South Seattle - these are all housing developments - low-income, stable housing opportunities in the 37th. That's one thing. The second thing is - I agree - lift the ban on rent control on the state level. Number two is definitely providing increasing - no, lowering the income level for seniors to qualify for these tax deferments. I've talked to multiple seniors who are living on Social Security and who cannot qualify for King County's tax exemptions or deferments, and so that's a hardship on our seniors. In addition to that, I do agree with middle housing, but what I want to see is that we're not continuing to displace community as we're bringing more density in. We need to be more equitable and look at the houses in the communities on the north side of the Montlake Bridge - let them carry some of the weight of some of the housing developments, because what we don't want to do is continue to keep displacing folks.

We have just recently did our open house in the William Grose Center - that is a hub to make sure that we have a think tank and provide opportunities for our youth for the tech world. But that took community building, going to the City's office to get the land transferred - that took organizing. It also means you have to make sure that our children are prepared for kindergarten and making sure their reading and their math is on par at third grade. Making sure our freshmen are finishing their freshman year. So really being an advocate in Seattle Public Schools, making sure the strategic plan and the resources are going to those furthest from educational justice. That's what I do in real time. But the William Grose Center is what the community locked arms and myself as a leadership on co-convening the Black Community Impact Alliance - that's what we've done for the digital divide. And my children have benefited from the opportunities from coding, from change makers, from all the different things that our public schools do not offer. And our school system needs to be fully funded, particularly making sure those who are receiving special education services get a real opportunity - because you can't close the divide if you're dropping out of school or they're sending our kids to prison. You can't get the opportunity if you're not graduating.

        "text": "Yeah, I agree. There's a ton that we can do for education. I'll speak specifically about what we can do to close the digital divide. It's crazy to think that more than 50% of our students aren't competent in math and sciences - that is just plain scary. And we have to change that. And that's in high school. And so we have to make sure that we improve our STEM education. We have to make sure that we do public-private partnerships to bring tech education into our junior highs and high schools. It's an embarrassment that we have so many resources here in this area, but yet our tech education lags behind many other places in the country and the world. When we also look at STEM and tech, we can't only afford to have people getting a good job out of tech. We need multiple ways for people to get good jobs. So to me, that looks like creating pipelines to the trades. For too long, we've sort of said, Oh, you went into the trades because you can't hack college. No, you went into the trades maybe because you like to work with your hands, or you want a job that can't get offshored, or you want dependable hours - two of my best friends went through four-year college, got jobs, hated them, came back, became journeymen electricians, get paid more than those jobs that they had going to college. One's about to start a business. And so making sure that the trades are a respected option for our kids is important, just like it should be an option to go into technology. And then we should also fund free two-year college. Free four-year college is great - we should definitely get there. However, we need to start with free two-year college, just like the Seattle Promise, because 50% of Seattle graduating seniors applied for that, and 1,000 took part in it.",

And so I really, truly want to get that removed, because how are we going to expect our youth to graduate and get to these opportunities, but we're already setting them back because they made a mistake? And we understand the brain science and the development there is that their brains are not fully matured.

        "text": "So I think we need to think about public safety comprehensively as more than just police. This is something that is near and dear to my heart. When I was at Brown, we had an open campus - me and my best friend were walking around campus onto a public street and Brown police came and asked me and my friend for our IDs. I didn't do anything wrong, so I continued to walk. My friend stopped, told him who I was, showed him his ID, but that didn't stop Brown police from calling out for backup. Providence police got that call, caught up with me and beat me so badly that they had to take me to the hospital before they took me to jail. Despite that experience, I still think police are part of public safety, but we have to be able to hold the police force accountable, or we're not going to have trust with the police force. I want to work with them to make sure that we set them up for success, so that we are sending a mental health counselor out to mental health crises - because they are trained to deal with these situations - and the person receiving a service will get a better service than sending three or four cops. We don't need cops in schools, we need counselors in schools. And so I think if we think more comprehensively about public safety, then we'll get better outcomes for the community and a better relationship with the police force. We should also fund like violence preventer programs. We should get guns off the streets - one of the sad things about gun violence prevention is that there are very, very common sense gun laws that 60, 70, 80 percent of people agree on. However, federal legislators can't get their act together, so we need to make sure that those laws pass here in our state.",

    {
        "text": "Thank you. When I think about public safety, I think about community safety - it's not just a conversation just about what the police are doing in community. It's also about how does the community feel safe - with the police. So there has to be an accountability conversation. So on the King County Community Safety Violence Prevention Task Force that I've served on, really it came down - of all their research and all their conversations and co-design - it really came down to families needing their basic needs met. Housing, education, food security, the basic needs - they believe that that's what it's gonna take to really bring prevention. So our state has already been working at some things with regard to guns and taking, looking at how many bullets, a clip - I don't know, got so many words coming - reducing how many bullets that you can have. I think that we need to make sure that every person who gets a gun needs to have a class - similar, if you want to get your driver's license, you need to learn how to drive - we need to learn how to use a firearm. You also need to make sure that it is locked up. Again, I am solely endorsed by the Alliance for Gun Responsibility. So community safety, also - we need to look at the funding that's coming from the State Department - so there's federal money that was brought down to the state, they've started a new division. We need to work with that division to make sure that it's meaningful in the 37th, because the 37th has different issues. We're not looking at machine guns and going into the schools in that way. What we're looking at is handguns that we gotta get removed and get them off the street. Thank you.",

        "text": "We gotta get out, we gotta go on the state level, we have to be loud and proud, and we have to make sure that the funding is fully funded. Of course, special education is not being resourced. Our special education students tend to be the main students that are getting pushed into the prison pipeline. So I am definitely gonna be loud and proud up there to make sure that that occurs, because we can't waver there. But Seattle Public Schools is also advocating to our state legislators right now, because the issue is that there was a tweak in the formula - that Seattle Public Schools is not getting as much money that it needs, but we also want to make sure our teachers are getting livable wages. And so it's coming to a point that if something's not addressed and more funding doesn't come into the education system, then maybe the public education here at Seattle Public Schools may falter. They're not sure what to do, teachers may go onto a strike. So we will have to figure it out, and we're gonna have to figure it out without taking away our children's basic needs - we should not be taking healthcare out of our schools, we should not be taking our social workers and mental health counselors away from our students. We have to do all the things, and we just have to figure it out and get creative. There are some great leaders there around education, but I'm a fierce advocate as well, and I don't think we should leave any student behind, especially those who are receiving special education services.

        "text": "So currently there's a funding cap on how much Seattle Public Schools gets reimbursed for special education funding, and if we were to remove that, Seattle Public Schools would get another $100 million that it would be able to put towards that. That is just a start. We - McCleary got us closer to funding education, but we do not fully fund it, and this becomes a revenue issue. Washington State has the most regressive tax code in the whole country, despite how progressive and liberal that we claim we are. We need to make sure that every corporation and person pays their fair share - so that looks like closing corporate tax loopholes, making sure that we keep our capital gains tax, which is - the revenue from that is used to fund early education, which is a necessary part of the education system - and then also implementing a wealth tax. Personally, I would prefer an income tax because an income tax is - you can withhold that. It's been tried before, we know how to implement that - however, there are constitutional issues with that. So in lieu of an income tax, we should be able to try a billionaire tax. And the thing that gives me hope is while things get stymied on the federal level, we've seen localities and states try out new things, and so maybe this is something that we can pilot here in the state, and at the end of the day, a billionaire tax and an income tax aren't mutually exclusive. We can still work towards an income tax, even if we have a billionaire tax.",

And so that's my relationship. Second part to that question is - again, part of being Chief of Staff with King County Equity Now and just having relationships in that community - making sure that we got money from the state level to support Petah Village - early learning development, and also just the new outside - door - preschool, right? There's leadership there, there's expertise there, there's churches there, there's a nail shop - there's all the things that are near and dear to my heart, to be honest. That community is mine - not mine, but it's shared. I was on the Community Investment Budget Committee for King County's participatory budgeting to make sure that money was stored in a way that was definitely led by community members and getting the input from community members to see how they want to move that and looking to make sure that King County does it again in the future. So that was $10 million. We had a celebration about a few weeks ago, naming the projects that were funded. So yeah, this is near and dear to my heart - has been neglected, Skyway has been ignored.

So for example, when I got to Brown, I noticed that the pre-med students had a great support group to help other students of color get through pre-med, but we did not have that in the engineering. So I restarted our chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers so that we had a community to not only get us through, but also pull in the next class of freshmen and sophomores to get them through. I've continued to do that in Seattle. I serve on the board of a program called Institute for a Democratic Future where the goal is to increase the Democratic Party across the state. I loved that program when I went through it, but one of the reasons I joined the board was to make sure that we had more equity in the fellows and the board members. And in my six years, we have dramatically changed what the class makeup looks like, both racially but also geographically, so that we have a stronger Democratic Party across the state so that we can win in every district. And then on the board itself, we have drastically increased the number of people of color and women of color on the board. And we actually now have our first woman of color who is the Board Chair. So this is something that I've been doing in all aspects of my life - even at Microsoft, equity was a huge thing for me. I required that we interview a person of color or underrepresented minority for every opening on the team that I led, and we ended with a team of 40% people of color or underrepresented minorities.

It's because most of the people of color have been pushed here and redlined here. So I have to look at all those impacts and structures that are in place and figure out what's the best route to go.

But I don't see right now where there would be harm to that, but there needs to be more education - for me. As a PTSA president, there was a mother who came - and her child, she felt, was being bullied. I supported to make sure that our students and that whole school community understood what identity safety really meant, not just for the LGBTQ+, but also any person who's being othered or who needs to be shored up to not be bullied or be teased about their identity. My son was teased for multiple years just because of his weight. I know those two things don't compare, but I do understand the impact of what happens when our children are targeted and othered.

And so as a community member and being part of that collective work - trying to support the legislator - to give them messaging opportunities, how to help educate those who are in the caucus to try to move something forward because we know it's vital for the community members outside of the Legislature. So it's just really doing the same thing, but also I see myself and my leadership as making sure I'm connected to a base of community folks who are impacted by the issue, making sure those with lived experiences' voices are at the table, and taking that forward into the caucus. Because too often - I'm here to do transformational, change the status quo - and too often the people who are in the back rooms are not connected to the real impacts of what they're making decisions about. So using that collective voice, making sure people are being informed and they're informing me, and moving that back to the caucus - that's the way I plan to move because I've seen success happen from that. I've seen us as community members say, You need to talk about this from a racial justice angle. Go back and do it. Oh, you are not communicating with community - that's why this legislation is having some issues. You need to make sure you're connecting more with us.

        "text": "So I think as a legislator, relationships are very important and that's something that I have experience with. My day job at Microsoft is I work for the Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft and I have to advise our executives on emerging technology. But I don't have any power over these executives - I don't give them headcount, I don't tell them where they're going to put their resources. And so my effectivity in my job is based on how well I can build a relationship with them and bring them towards my point of view. And so I think that is a very similar thing to what we have to do in the Democratic caucus because everyone in the Democratic Party doesn't vote the way we want them to. And so if we can create trusting relationships with them - I can use my lived experience, I can bring feedback from the community to show them why they may not be voting in the best ways. And through that - I think the first thing to do is get ahead of the problem in the first place - the question was, how would I work if we were in conflict with caucus? First, let's try and bring the caucus into synchronization on what needs to be done. If that can't happen, then we can start to bring other voices from outside to more forcibly show them why this is wrong and make a case that there is a groundswell that supports a certain way of voting - to make sure that they understand they're not going to get voted out, that they are supported, that this is the right way to go, and that the public wants us to vote in more progressive legislation.",

        "text": "Yeah, I would love to follow up. I just want to highlight that sometimes a conflict is not within the caucus. Sometimes the conflict is that you're having to deal with the other side as partisan politics. So sometimes it might be around the strategy. And so some things are going to get cut out or be less prioritized than the other. I definitely have relationships in Olympia with multiple legislators - if you check my website, ElectEmijah.com, you will see the multiple representatives and senators that I already work with. Sometimes it's about the strategy - and I would love to see that our Democratic Party go hard, be more courageous when we're dealing with on the other side of the aisle, because they are not caring about our strategy. They're going hard.",

        "text": "Yes, while there are certain subjects that we have to fight the Republican Party on, like the right to choose, there are also instances where there may be a member across the aisle that I disagree with on 90% of stuff, but I will work with them on that 10% to move that issue forward - and then we can go back and fight about the other 90%. So while I think it's very important that we understand where we're coming from, working across the aisle is deeply important to me. And not flaming them, in certain instances, so that we can make progress on the small that we agree on - a small bit that we agree on - is important so that we can make that progress.",

    {
        "text": "Yes, we should - I thought we got rid of cash bail - I may be misinformed on that, but yes, I would be supportive of not having cash bail. I would also be supportive of returning parole - the option of parole - which got taken away in 1984. It's clear that we have far too many people locked up and that increased jail sentences don't lead to more public safety. Just in COVID, we let out 11,000 people into home confinement and there were only 17 re-offenses, one of which was violent. If that's not enough evidence to show that we are keeping too many people in jail, I don't know what is. So not only in terms of bail - bail is one means of keeping people in jail, but also is parole. We should bring back the option of parole and we should look for any option that we can get to get non-violent offenders out, because data shows that they are not necessarily going to re-offend and we don't need to be keeping them in prison. We need them to be back home with their families so that we have sound communities.",

    {
        "text": "I definitely would support bail reform. I agree with Chipalo about the no cash bail, but I also believe there's some language in the bail language that you can - if somebody is supportive and around you that they can go be with you, like back in community - I don't know the exact details of the language, but I would love to support something like that. I'm definitely a justice reform advocate, so bringing parole back - of course - making sure people are not dying in prison, making - if it's not in the interest of justice, then we need to be able to allow people to have an opportunity to come back and be reconnected with their families and community. Families and community connections are the number one - it's the number one thing that makes sure people are not going back and committing crimes, other than having their basic needs met, of course. I also want to think about the time bar - people don't talk about that, but our society - and those people are really set up, they do not know the legal system, and they only have one year after they are sentenced to try to work that legal system to have an appeal. Well, I think that that needs to be expanded multiple years, if not eliminated, so that as our laws change and as we, our policies are coming to the morality of how we're thinking and our healing in society, we need to make sure that people who are innocent have an opportunity to come out and be resentenced.

        "speech": "Crystal Fincher"
    },
    {
        "text": "I love that question, because when I think about restitution - when someone's sentenced, they oftentimes have legal financial obligations - which people shouldn't be penalized and needing to go back to jail because they have a legal financial obligation - but also there's restitution. And oftentimes when they're collecting those fines, it's supposed to go to restitution, but oftentimes it's not prioritized. So first and foremost, restitution needs to be prioritized. When there is a fine to be paid or our courts are getting that money, prioritize the victims to make sure they're getting it - oftentimes it's also being prioritized towards the courts. Another aspect of that is we need to listen to the victims, because it's about restorative justice. So healing needs to happen for those who've been harmed, but healing needs to also happen for those who have harmed somebody. And so having a restorative justice opportunity - I found, being a victim myself, that if I decide what I want to see happens in that justice system, they don't listen to victims oftentimes. They don't listen to how we want to move that restorative process, because how we want to do our healing in community might look different than what the legal system wants to do. So more victims need to have choice about how they want to do that. There's a redemption or opportunity that people want to come back to that person who violated, and they should have the opportunity to do that. So making sure that restitution is happening - the finances go there. Making sure that victims, if they choose, have an opportunity for healing, and they should be able to decide what that process needs to look like for their healing. Thank you.",

        "text": "Yeah, I completely agree that victims should have a voice in determining or possibly moderating the type of sentence that is passed down. But there's also some structural barriers in our society that possibly put victims in harm's way. So for example, domestic violence victims can't break lease without penalty. And so I would 100% support allowing a victim of domestic violence to get out of a lease immediately so that they can find new housing and reduce the chances that they have another instance of domestic violence committed upon them. And so I think there's lots of these unintended consequences of our laws and systems that we can analyze through a victim's point of view to make sure that not only is the original crime addressed, but they don't fall victim to subsequent crimes after that.",

    {
        "text": "Yeah, and also I just want to highlight implementation, again, around that restitution. Our courts need to be advised or something needs to be - they know what they need to do, but for some reason, there's some disconnect or miscommunication around how things are supposed to happen. And too often, communities have to have all the information to direct the court, so there needs to be more implementation conversation. I also want to share that maybe it's not leveled across the state, and I definitely want to level domestic violence type of supports across the state. But I know here in King County, and particularly in the 37th, if you are violated by domestic violence, you can break your lease without penalty. But victim defendants is also something that we need to address, and that King County right now is providing services for those who might be victim defendants, and I would love to see that leveled up.",
